Task 1: See 'gymenv'

Task 2 & 3: 

- See 'db_connect_and_create'
    - Insert your password in 'get_db_connection' function
    - Reference 'create_tables' function for information related to how tables were created for the application

- Run 'app.py' and test using Postman

Notes:
- When adding a workout, you do not need to enter a date & time. This will be automatically input using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
- When updating a workout, you may change all values except the session_id, including the date and time of the workout session.
